# FinTech-Case-Study


A case study observing Robinhood 

## Overview and Origin

Ronbinhood Financial LLC.

Established on 08/24/2012. SEC approved on 10/14/2013.

The founders Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt.

While working for large hedge funds, Vlad and Baiju, noticed that it cost next to nothing to execute trades, yet big firms charged a hefty sum to get this job done and set out to change that. Providing really cheap trading for individual investors became a real possibility.

The company is funded by 56 investors, of which 9Yards Capitol and Sequoa Capitol are the most recent. The company has recieved over $5.6 billion to run.

## Business Activities:

The problem Robinhood is trying to solve is the barriers of entry many individual investors have to get started to invest in the stock market. Through commission-free trading and no minimum to get started trading on the stock exchange it is now possible for these investors to get on board and invest in financial intrusments such as securities and derivatives.

Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? Its intended customer is the "millenial" generation. Since Robinhood uses a mobile platform mainly to deliver its services the information found is that they have a pool of 79.6 million customers to target since this is the statistical number of millenials that use mobile phones. 

The company began the offer of absolutely free commission trading for all users, which was not a reality at the time. It also offered a freindly-user interface that almost anyone can use with ease to make trading easy. An unfair advantage they possessed was the advanced FinTech used in their high-speed trading platforms. 

Technologies such as Python, React, Nginx, Redis, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, Ubuntu, Amazon EC2, Sass, Django, Redux, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Swift, Go, Kotlin, Memcached, Django REST Framework, Celery, Airflow, Rxjava, and Faust which focus on application and data. Google analytics, Elasticsearch,and Retrofit as utilities. GitHub, Git, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Webpack, Kibana, Babel, Grafana, Sentry, Terraform, Vagrant, Logstash, Prometheus, Consul, ELK, Zookeeper, Vault, Fabric, Salt, StatsD, Phabricator, Sensu, LXC as developer tools. Slack, G Suite, Confluence, Asana for business tools. 

## Landscape:

Financial Investment Services such as stocks and ETF trading, cryptocurrency trading and banking. 

Market movement towards the use of blockchain technology, increased automation of financial services, and the use of big data to study consumer behaviors and spending patterns. The sharing economy is becoming big now with individuals acting as banks for other individuals. In the next 5 to 10 years we can may see a new banking industry arise from all these different market movers changing the current landscape. 

Acorns, Webull, Stash and eToro to name a few. 

## Results
So far to create a shift in the way other big firms operate such as TDAmeritrade that changed to commision free trading, as well as Wells Fargo that is introducing commision free trading as well as bot trading. The company has also created a new wave of investors called retail invesstors who have moved markets like never before seen in history. 

The company tracks hte number of users operating its platform, provide incentive to share the experience with other prospective users by giving free stocks to those who share and those who download the app, they also provide simple to digest financial education allowing users to make better decisions increasing retention. 

As of right now, Robinhood is the most popular investment app out there. It is an industry game changer and generating competition from its disruption with Stash and WeBull as two other investment apps that have potential of catching up. 

## Recommendations

I would suggest they offer more trading tools in their desktop site, as well as brokerage services with professionals ready to help with investment advice for those investors that are more experienced to ensure retnetion of users. Lastly, I would add a social platform inside the app to allow traders to share ideas and collaborate on trading strategies and finally run a blockchain based ledger to best read the huge traffic of order flows. 

It would benefit the company greatly by generating growth and expanded reach of new customers with deeper accounts and trading experience. The social aspect can create communities of investors that share a common goal. This will promote more and more users to join and their mission to provide access to investments will be immense. 

Social media platform, financial professionals and services, and Blockchain technology which is very new but highly specified for things such as order flow and transaction tracking. 

These technologies are appropriate to my solution because of the promise it has towards privacy, automation, transaction flow, and decrease the need of a middle man handling trading flow.
